👋 Hi, I’m Cristian
👀 I’m a Web Developer focused on Shopify & WordPress, specializing in CRO-driven development, custom themes, and performance optimization.

🌱 I’m currently deepening my skills in modern JavaScript, React JS, and TypeScript to support more advanced front-end workflows and custom Shopify experiences.

💞️ I’m open to collaborating on:
- Shopify theme customization & Shopify 2.0 builds  
- CRO improvements (PDPs, funnels, upsells, UX tweaks)  
- WordPress custom themes, performance optimization, and clean builds  
- Long-term eCommerce and SaaS projects

⚡ Fun fact:
I enjoy optimizing existing stores more than building from scratch — small changes, big conversion wins.
